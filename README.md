Welcome to my personal webpage. I lead the Autonomous Navigation System (ANS) Research Group at the Research Center for Intelligent Computing Systems, Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). ANS is focused on cutting-edge research in autonomous driving techniques.
